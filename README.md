pyRoMan - a Python ROMs Manager

At this stage, pyRoMan is just an idea. I envision creating a ROMs manager in Python, primarily focused on checking and validating MAME ROMs.

While there are many excellent existing programs, my motivation stems from the lack of robust native solutions for Mac computers. I intend to develop a set of useful Python scripts and integrate them into a cohesive application, filling this gap.
